A repository for our submission to the GTMK Game Jam 2023. This year's\
theme is "Reversed Roles".

Play it now: https://pinggames.itch.io/humansters

## Our idea

We live in a parallel universe where animals have humans as their\
pets. Our character is the housepet of a hamster child and resides in\
a cage in their room, when one day they discover that the door has not\
been closed properly. Since they have never been outside of their\
cage, our hero is very curious and would like to explore the outer\
world.

But beware of the *Humansters!* These very human-like hamsters will\
take you back to your cage as soon as they see you.

Start exploring a cozy world with a small character and a huge\
environment on their way to freedom!
